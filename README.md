# Lung Segmentation Using U-Net

This repository contains a deep learning model for lung segmentation from chest X-ray images. The model is built using the U-Net architecture and trained on a dataset of chest X-ray images with corresponding lung masks.


## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing can be found on Kaggle:  
[Chest X-Ray Lungs Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamtapendu/chest-x-ray-lungs-segmentation)

It includes:
- Chest X-ray images as input.
- Corresponding lung segmentation masks as ground truth.


<!-- ## Model Architecture
